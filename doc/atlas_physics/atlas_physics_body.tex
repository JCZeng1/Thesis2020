\section{\File{atlasphysics.sty} style file}
\label{sec:atlasphysics}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \File{atlasphysics.sty} style file implements a series of useful
shortcuts to typeset a physics paper, such as particle
symbols.

Options are parsed with the \Package{kvoptions} package, which is included by default.
The style file can included in the preamble of your paper with the usual
syntax:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{\ATLASLATEXPATH atlasphysics}
\end{verbatim}
%
As of version 01-00-00 the file is actually split into smaller files,
which can be included or not using options.
The following options are available, where the default setting is given in parentheses:
\begin{description}
\item[BSM](false) BSM and SUSY particles.
\item[hion](false) Useful macros for heavy ion physics.
\item[jetetmiss](false) Useful macros for Jet/Etmiss publications.
\item[journal](true) Journal abbreviations and a few other definitions for references.
\item[math](false) A few extra maths definitions.
\item[misc](true) Miscellaneous definitions that are often used.
\item[other](false) Definitions that used to be in \File{atlasphysics.sty}, 
  but are probably too specialised to be needed by most people.
\item[particle](true) Standard Model particles and some combinations.
\item[hepparticle](false) Standard Model particles and some combinations using the \Package{hepparticle} package.
  This option will supersede \Option{particle} at some time.
\item[process](false) Some example processes. 
  These are not included by default as the current choice is rather arbitrary
  and certainly not complete.
\item[hepprocess](false) Some example processes using the \Package{hepparticle} package.
  These are not included by default as the current choice is rather arbitrary
  and certainly not complete.
  This option will supersede \Option{process} at some time.
\item[unit](true) Units that used to be defined -- not needed if you use \Package{siunitx} or \Package{hepunits}.
\item[xref](true) Useful abbreviations for cross-references.
\item[texlive=YYYY](2016) Set if you use an older version of \TeX\ Live like 2009.
\item[texmf] Use the syntax \Macro{usepackage\{package\}}
  instead of \Macro{usepackage\{\textbackslash ATLASLATEXPATH package\}} to include packages.
  This is needed if you install \Package{atlaslatex} centrally,
  rather than in a \File{latex} subdirectory.
\end{description}
Note that \Option{BSM} and \Option{BSM=true} are equivalent.
Use the syntax \Option{option=false} to turn off an option.

If the  option \Option{texmf} is included, the subfiles are included using the command:
\verb|\RequirePackage{atlasparticle}| etc. instead of \verb|\RequirePackage{\ATLASLATEXPATH atlasparticle}|.
This is useful if you install the ATLAS \LaTeX\ package in a central directory such as \File{\$\{HOME\}/texmf/tex/latex}.

All definitions are done in a consistent way using \verb|\newcommand*|.
All definitions use \verb|\ensuremath| where appropriate and are terminated with
\verb|\xspace|, so you can simply write {\verb|\ttbar production| instead of
\verb|\ttbar\ production| or \verb|\ttbar{} production| to get \enquote{\ttbar production}.

The \Package{hepparticles}~\cite{hepparticles} package has uniform definitions for many Standard Model and BSM particles.
In fact you should use the package \Package{heppennames} and/or \Package{hepnicenames},
which contain many predefined particles.
These packages load \Package{hepparticles}, which can then be used to define more particles if you need them.
One very nice feature of these packages is that you can switch between italic and upright symbols via an option.

See \Sect{\ref{sec:old}} for details on changes that were introduced when
when going from version 00-04-05 of \Package{atlasnote}
to version 01-00-00 of \Package{atlaslatex}.
Let me know if you spot some other changes that are not documented here!

Changes to the contents that might affect existing documents are given in \Sect{\ref{sec:change}}.

The following sections list the macros defined in the various files.
