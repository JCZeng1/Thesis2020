In this chapter, we outline our fitting approach and present the main results of the fit. 
Our goal is to measure the signal strength ($\mu_{VBS}$) of the EW $VV$+jj production within the VBS-enhanced phase space for the 1-lepton channel, 
using a DNN method. 
Detailed discussions will be provided in Section~\ref{sec:Fit_Results_ub}.

The fit model is constructed using MC-based templates for both the signal and background processes. In addition to estimating the primary parameters of interest (POIs), the model aims to constrain the normalization of the predominant background processes, specifically \Wjets and \ttbar production, using dedicated control CRs established in earlier chapters. Minor backgrounds, such as $VV$ and single-top processes, are adjusted using priors, with specific extrapolation parameters derived for them. The model incorporates the main sources of systematic uncertainties, applying normalization and/or shape effect schemes as appropriate. 
%The approach to de-correlating these uncertainties will be detailed in Section \ref{subsec:fit_options}.
