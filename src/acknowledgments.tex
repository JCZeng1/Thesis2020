Also, I would like to say thank you to my late grandparents. Though you might not have fully understood my work, I am grateful for every memory we shared. Finally, to my parents, Meizhen Zhu and Yuesong Zeng, who moved across continents to allow me to fulfill my dream of becoming a physicist: It has been a long journey, and I cannot thank you enough for your unwavering support and patience. There is still a long journey ahead of me, and I am determined to make you proud with every step I take.
