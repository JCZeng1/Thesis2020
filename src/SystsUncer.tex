This section describes the sources of systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis. 
These uncertainties are divided into three categories: experimental uncertainties, uncertainties on the modelling of background processes, and theoretical uncertainties on the signal processes. In the statistical analysis each systematic uncertainty is treated as a nuisance parameter, the names of which are defined below.
These systematic variations are estimated on the final discriminant.
