%These systematic variations are estimated on the final discriminant.
This chapter describes the sources of systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis, divided into three categories: experimental uncertainties, uncertainties on the modelling of background processes, and theoretical uncertainties on the signal processes. In the statistical analysis, each systematic uncertainty is treated as a nuisance parameter (NP); the names of these parameters are defined below. 
Unless specified, these NPs are included in the final binned maximum likelihood fit, which will be discussed further in Chapter~\ref{ch:stat_interpretation}.
