\label{subsec:tracks_uncer}
We incorporate dedicated uncertainties related to track reconstruction, particularly for tracks associated with small-$R$ jets.
The following procedure~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-009} is used to derive these track multiplicity-related uncertainties, which comprise five main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fake track efficiency: the uncertainty from the track mis-reconstruction rate;
    \item track efficiency: the uncertainty from the track reconstruction efficiency;
    \item experimental: the uncertainty in charged particle multiplicity, derived as in \cite{CERN-PH-EP-2016-001};
    \item PDF: the theory uncertainty from the parton distribution function;
    \item matrix element: the theory uncertainty from the matrix element calculation;
\end{itemize}
The impacts from these uncertainties are expected to be minimal.
