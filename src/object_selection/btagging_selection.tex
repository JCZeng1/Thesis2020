%\subsection{Jet flavor tagging selection}
\label{subsec:flavortagging}

Due to the short lifetime of the $t$ quark, it decays before hadronization, with a $99.8\%$ chance of decaying into a $b$ quark. 
As a result, a $b$-tagging method is used to reject events originating from \ttbar 
and single top events. 
In this analysis, small-R jets are tagged using the new DL1r $b$-tagging score available in ATLAS~\cite{FTAG-2018-01}.
The DL1r $b$-tagging is based on a deep-learning neural network using distinctive features of b-hadrons~\cite{Aad2023flavour}.
As specified in Section~\ref{subsec:cr_selection}, the b-tagged jets are used to define the TopCR within the \olep phase space.
A summary of the $b$-tagging requirements in the resolved category is shown in Table~\ref{tab:b_tag_resolved}.
