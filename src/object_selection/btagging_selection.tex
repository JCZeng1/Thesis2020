%\subsection{Jet flavor tagging selection}
\label{subsec:flavortagging}

Due to the short lifetime of the $t$ quark, it decays before hadronization, with a $99.8\%$ chance of decaying into a $b$ quark. 
Consequently, a $b$-tagging method is used to reject events originating from \ttbar 
and single top events. 
In this analysis, small-R jets are tagged using the new DL1r $b$-tagging score available in ATLAS \cite{FTAG-2018-01}.
Subsequently, the b-tagged jets define the TopCR within the \olep phase space, as specified in Section \ref{subsec:cr_selection}.
%
%The small-R jets are used for $b$-tagging. This pass of the analysis moved to use
%the new DL1r b-tagging score available in ATLAS \cite{FTAG-2018-01}.
%
Summary of the $b$-tagging requirements in the resolved category is shown in Table~\ref{tab:b_tag_resolved}.
%The efficiency working point used in the previous analysis is used for this pass.

%In particular, we use $b$-tagging for two aims:

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item during the tagging selection of the VBS jets candidates, as described in section \ref{subsec:vbs_selection};
%  \item to define the TopCR in \olep phase space, according to the definition in \ref{subsec:cr_selection}
%\end{itemize}
