%\subsection{Overlap Removal}
%%%The reconstruction of the same energy deposits as multiple objects is resolved 
%%%using the standard overlap removal tools, AssociationUtils, 
%%%documented \href{https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/blob/21.2/PhysicsAnalysis/AnalysisCommon/AssociationUtils/README.rst}{here} 
%%%and summarized in Table~\ref{tab:OR}.

We utilize the standard overlap removal tools, AssociationUtils, to manage the overlaps between analysis-level objects (electrons, muons, jets, etc.). This approach ensures that the same energy deposits are not used in the reconstruction of multiple analysis-level objects. The specific overlap tools employed in this analysis are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:OR}.
The overlap between small-R and large-R jets will be addressed in the later stages of the selection process by adopting a ``Merged over Resolved'' regime categorization, as detailed in Sections \ref{subsec:sr_selection} and \ref{subsubsec:merged_jets_selection}.

%%%In particular, we do not use any specific removal for small-R and large-R jets 
%%%at this stage of the objects selection. Indeed, we deal with overlap between
%%%small-R and large-R for the identification of the $\Vqq$ decay products introducing 
%%%a Merged over Resolved regime categorisation, described in Section \ref{subsec:sr_selection}.
%%%In particular, in the Merged regime, the large-R signal jet candidate is firthermore required to be at $DR>1.4$ 
%%%with respect to tagging jets as described in section \ref{subsubsec:merged_jets_selection}.
