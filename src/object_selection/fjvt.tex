\subsection{fJVT}
\label{subsec:fjvt}

In the context of the pile-up jets suppression, forward-JetVertexTagger (fJVT) has been introduced in this round of the analysis to mitigate the jet candidates contributions coming from pile-up interaction rather than the hard processes we are targeting. This is motivated mainly by the forward-like topology we are interested in. In particular, Loose WP is used, as described in section \ref{subsec:vbs_selection}, and recommendation are followed from the internal twiki \mbox{\texttt{\href{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/PileupJetRecommendations}{fJVT}}}.
