The analysis searches for electroweak diboson ($WW/WZ/ZZ$) production in association with a high-mass dijet system, using data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$. The analysis is performed in the semi-leptonic final states which include a hadronic decay boson and a leptonic decay one. The analysis is split into three channels according to the number of electrically charged leptons from the leptonic boson decay: 0-lepton channel, 1-lepton channel, and 2-lepton channel.
The focus of this thesis is an approach to enhance the separation between the VBS signal and the backgrounds in the 1-lepton channel using artificial neural network models. This approach is developed using Monte Carlo simulated events in the semi-leptonic VBS analysis and tested using ATLAS data for improving the sensitivity of the analysis to the target signal.
