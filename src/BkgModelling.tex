\chapter{Background Modeling and Estimations}
%%The modelling of major background processes is studied in this section.
%%Firstly, the mis-modelling of the VBS tagging jets invariant mass, \mjjtag, is studied for \Wjets\ and \Zjets.
%%Then various control regions for $W/Z$+jets and \ttbar\ backgrounds are defined in order to validate the modelling and constrain the normalization using data.

The modeling of major background processes, such as \Wjets\ and top quark pair (\ttbar) productions, is examined in this section.
Initially, the focus is on the study of mis-modeling in the invariant mass of the Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) Tag Jets, denoted as \mjjtag, particularly in \Wjets\ events for the \olep channel. Subsequently, various control regions for $W$+jets and \ttbar\ backgrounds are established. These are instrumental in validating the modeling and constraining the normalization based on data.
