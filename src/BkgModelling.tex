\chapter{Background Modeling and Estimations}

The modeling of major background processes, such as \Wjets and top quark pair (\ttbar) productions, is examined in this section. 
Since \Zjets production has no meaningful contribution to the \Vjets backgrounds in the \olep channel, we focus solely on \Wjets for simplicity. 
Initially, attention is directed towards the study of mismodeling in the invariant mass of the VBS Tag Jets, denoted as \mjjtag, specifically within \Wjets events in the \olep channel. 
Subsequently, various control regions for \Wjets and \ttbar backgrounds are established. These regions are instrumental in validating the modeling and constraining the normalization based on data.
