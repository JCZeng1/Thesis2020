\subsection{Control Regions (CRs) definitions}
\label{subsec:cr_selection}

We use a combined MC template and data-driven background estimation, indeed, we rely on the MC simulations samples for the SM background processes, but we use dedicated Control Regions (CRs) to constrain the normalization of the background expectation in the SRs.

The dedicated CRs to the $Z$+jets, $W$+jets and \ttbar events are defined in this section.

The $Z$+jets, $W$+jets and \ttbar CRs are used in this analysis shared 
across the the 0-, 1- and 2-lepton channels;
for instance, the \ttbar CR is defined using \olep events only, 
and used to constraint this background in all the SRs.
Independent CRs for resolved and merged categories are, instead,
used to account for possible mis-modelling of the background depending on \pt range.

\subsubsection{$W$+jets CR (WCR) and $Z$+jets CR (ZCR)}
%\textbf{$W$+jets CR (WCR) and $Z$+jets CR (ZCR)}

The $V$+jets CR (VCR) for $V=W/Z$, $W$+jets CR (WCR), and $Z$+jets CR (ZCR) are defined using the mass sidebands with respect to hadronically decaying vector boson in 0-, 1-, and 2-lepton channels, respectively.
The event selections are otherwise the same as the SR selections.
For the simplicity of the analysis, the common sideband is defined as the outside of both $W\to q\bar{q}$ and $Z \to q\bar{q}$ signal regions.
The same definition is used in all channels:
In the resolved category, a requirement of $50 < m_{jj} < 64$ GeV or $m_{jj} > 106$ GeV is applied which is an inversion of the $m_{jj}$ cut in the corresponding SR.
In the merged case, the event has to fail the vector boson tagger's lower working point of $\epsilon=80\%$.
%In the merged category, the purity of the $W$+jets background is 77\,\% in the lower mass side band, 62\,\% in the higher mass side band region and 65\,\% in total. The $t\bar{t}$ contamination is 30\,\% in higher mass side band regions. 

Figure \ref{fig:1lep2lepMVHadResCR} shows an example of sideband distributions in the resolved regions.
Figure \ref{fig:1lep2lepMVHadMerCR} shows an example of fat jet mass distributions in the merged control region; 
since the merged CR is defined using the full tagger 80\% WP, the mass distribution collects events both 
in the sidebands both in the mass window.

\subsubsection{$t\bar{t}$ CR (TCR)}
%\textbf{$t\bar{t}$ CR (TCR)}

%Two sets of the \ttbar CR (TR1 and TR2) can be used in this analysis.

In 1-lepton channel, TCR is defined by requiring at least one $b$-tagged jet instead of $b$-veto; distributions of the b-jets multiplicity for both resolved and merged regime are shown in figure \ref{fig:1lepNBjetsPresel}. 
%The purity of the $t\bar{t}$ background in this 
%region is 85\,\%. Signal contamination in both $W$+jets and $t\bar{t}$ control regions is negligible. The purity 
%of $W$+jets in WR is a bit poor, but the simultaneous fit to TR and WR makes it possible to determine the 
%normalization of $W$+jets correctly, thanks to high purity of $t\bar{t}$ in TR.

Since, the orthogonal cut is represented by the additional bjets in the event, 
the TCR correspond to mass window phase spaces, therefore, for the merged regime
TCR inherit the HP and LP splitting as for the SRs.
