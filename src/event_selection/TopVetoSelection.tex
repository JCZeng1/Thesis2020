%\subsection{EW Top production veto}
\subsubsection{EW Top production veto: Tight region definition}
\label{subsec:topveto_selection}

We found that the contribution of the EW Top production is still significant in our SRs. 

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:mc_sample_ewvvjj},
the EW Top and VVV processes are included in the signal MC samples. Since we want to enhance the VBS processes in our target phase space for the interpretation of data/MC agreement with the aQGC new physics model, we add additional selections to reduce the top contribution.

%\textcolor{red}{put here a table of the VV, VVV and top contributions in the SRs}

%\subsubsection{Loose and tight regions definition}
\label{subsec:LooseTightRegion}

We found that the resolved regions have much higher top contribution with respect to the merged ones.
For the top contribution in our signal sample, the top-quark mass can be reconstructed in the resolved SRs.
Two signal jets and the additional third jet which forms the three-jet mass, $m_{jjj}$, 
the closest to the top mass (172.76 \ GeV) are used. 
Additional third jet was chosen from all jets except for signal jets, including VBS tagging jets.

The resolved SRs are divided into two sub-categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Loose Resolved: this is the baseline region defined in Section~\ref{subsubsec:resolved_jets_selection}, and
  \item Tight Resolved: Loose Resolved + $M_{jjj} > 220 GeV$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Signal purity in merged and resolved regimes}
\label{subsec:SignalPurity}

The contribution of the three truth components of the EW signal has been checked with previous SR definition and with new $M_{jjj}$ selections.

%shows the summary for the \olep channel; 
show the summary of purity picture applying the tight cut for the resolved and merged regimes 
respectively, in the \zlep-\olep-\tlep channels.

Based on the improvements and studies performed, the reconstructed top-mass cut is only applied in the resolved signal region to define the new tight signal region, and the merged signal regions are left as they are.
