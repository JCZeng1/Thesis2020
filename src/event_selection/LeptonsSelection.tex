\subsection{Leptonically decaying boson}
\label{subsec:leptons_selection}

Events are categorized into 0-, 1- and 2-lepton channels by number of Loose leptons in the final state. The common definition of Loose lepton (see Sec.~\ref{sec:ObjectDefinition}) ensures three channels to be orthogonal. 
Basically we can follow the event selections used in the previous analysis based on the 36\,\ifb dataset\cite{Ryzhov:2310214}.
This section focuses on the dedicated selection we have for the three leptons channels.

\subsubsection{1-lepton channel}
\label{subsubsec:1lep_event_selection}
This section summarizes the SR definitions in 1-lepton channel.

\textbf{$W \to \ell\nu$}

To select events consistent with $W \to \ell\nu$ candidate, exactly one Tight lepton is required. In addition,
the following cuts are defined for all regions as common cuts:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\met > 80 \,\GeV$
\item $\ptl > 28 \,\GeV$ %and \textcolor{red}{I think this is related to lepSF binning} 
%\item $m_{J} > 50 \, \GeV$ (merged only)
\end{itemize}
are applied in the merged (resolved) analysis to suppress the multi-jet background.
Merged and resolved regime selections are discussed in details in Section \ref{subsec:sr_selection}.

Examples of distributions for MC samples as well as observed data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:1LepPreselCuts}; in particular, we can nicely see the W-peak in the $t\bar{t}$ process.

%After the $W \to \ell\nu$ selection above and $W/Z \to jj$ selection described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:resolved_jets_selection},
%the following selection cuts are required to take the event topology of which two high-\pt\ bosons are back--to--back in the $x$--$y$ plane:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\Delta \phi(\ell, \met)< XX$;
%\item $\Delta \phi(j1,j2) < XX$;
%\item $\Delta \phi(\ell,j1(2)) > XX$;
%\item $\Delta \phi(j1(2), \met) > XX$;
%\end{itemize}
%where $\Delta \phi(i, j)$ is the distance in the  coordinate between objects $i$ and $j$.

%%% 2-leptons channel

%In particular, modelling of the leading and sub-leading muon \pt look slighlty different. 
%This is an effect of the first bin in both distributions that has different values in the 
%data/MC ratio. After removing the first bin in the subleading muon \pt distribution the modelling
%qfor the two muons \pt is consistent as checked in Appendix \ref{app:leptonin2lep}.
